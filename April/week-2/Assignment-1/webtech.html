    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p> HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released. It was published in 1995
        as
        HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML. HTML is a very evolving markup
        language and has evolved with various versions updating.</p>
    <p> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a
        web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript. </p>
    <p> HTML (stands for Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online
        applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a
        series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document.</p>


    <h2>CSS </h2>
    <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994 while working with Tim
        Berners-Lee at CERN and the rest is history. CSS was not the only styling language in development at the time,
        but the very element of cascading and developing sequence is what set it apart from the rest.</p>
    <p> Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
        more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. </p>


    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p> JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262
        standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop
        JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.</p>
    <p> JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web
        pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an
        interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
    <p> The syntax of JavaScript is the set of rules that define a correctly structured JavaScript program. The examples
        below make use of the log function of the console object present in most browsers for standard text output. The
        JavaScript standard library lacks an official standard text output functivon</p>
    <p> JavaScript includes operators that perform some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and
        produce a result. JavaScript includes various categories of operators: Arithmetic operators, Comparison
        operators, Logical operators, Assignment operators, Conditional operators. </p>
